## SCN5A (NaV1.5) Variant Functional Perturbation and Clinical Presentation Variants of a Certain Significance
An analysis of the relationship between the penetrance of heart arrhythmias in carriers of SCN5A variants and <i>in silico</i> predictors (e.g. PROVEAN and PolyPhen-2) and functional parameters (e.g. variant-specific peak current, late current, volatages of activation, etc.). All code and data used in the corresponding manuscript (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29728395) are included here.

## Protein structure aids predicting functional perturbation of missense variants in SCN5A and KCNQ1
An analysis of features to predict the functional consequences of missense variants in the genes SCN5A and KCNQ1. We looked at sequence conservation, <i>in silico</i> variant classifiers, secondary structural elements, and many other structure-derived features. All code and data used in this publication (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30828412) are included here.

## A Bayesian method to estimate disease penetrance from genetic variant properties
Here we propose a method to estimate the penetrance of the heart arrhythmia Brugada syndrome attributable to variants in the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A. All code and data used and referenced in the manuscript (not yet accepted) are included here.

## Deep Mutational Scan of KCNH2
Here we develop an experimental method to quantitate variant-induced mistrafficking of missense variants in KCNH2. All code and data used and referenced in the manuscript (not yet accepted) are included here.
